# BinanceArbitrage
binance arbitrage project


An attempt at an arbitrage algorithm on the binance exchange. 

My finding were that it was not exceedingly profitable and resulted in my abandoning the project. 

Here is my code if anyone is interested in testing viability.

I found that you can expect to make roughly $1/route/day. This could mean that if you have enough assets and the proper server architechture that you may be able to make as much as several hundred dollars per day. 

Personally I do not have the ability to take this project any further, I wish you the best of luck if you seek to undertake this project. Do not be afraid to reach out to me.
