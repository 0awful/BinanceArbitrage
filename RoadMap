Stage 1: BTC LTC ETH BTC route and inverse route, trades
  subscribe to the inverse route too
  do the calculations in real time
  if it is above a certain profitability do the trade
  do all trades simultaneously

Refine the route object
  Route needs to be an object with quantities for all the tickers and the trade

Create a buy/sell function that takes a route and does the trade on the ticker
  create a meta object that does this for a whole route

Create a profitability checker
  If profitable, then calculate routes
  pass these routes to the order function

Run this shit on a different account, from a different server
  see what happens
